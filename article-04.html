            <h2>Virtual reality is evolving rapidly. What's next for immersive tech?</h2>
            
            <p>Virtual Reality has come a long way from the bulky, expensive headsets of the past. Today's VR technology is more accessible, more powerful, and more integrated into our daily lives than ever before. As we look to the future, the possibilities seem limitless.</p>

            <h3>Next-Generation Hardware</h3>
            <p>The latest VR headsets feature 4K+ resolution per eye, eliminating the "screen door effect" that plagued earlier devices. Eye-tracking technology enables foveated rendering, dramatically improving performance while reducing computational requirements. Standalone headsets like the Meta Quest 3 offer powerful experiences without the need for external computers.</p>

            <h3>Haptic Feedback Evolution</h3>
            <p>Future VR experiences will engage all senses. Advanced haptic suits and gloves can simulate touch, temperature, and even resistance. Companies are developing systems that let users "feel" virtual objects with remarkable accuracy, from the texture of fabric to the impact of a virtual tennis ball.</p>

            <h3>Brain-Computer Interfaces</h3>
            <p>The holy grail of VR - direct neural interfaces - is becoming reality. Companies like Neuralink and Valve are researching ways to read brain signals and translate them into VR actions. This could enable thought-controlled interfaces and even direct sensory input, creating truly seamless virtual experiences.</p>

            <h3>Social VR Spaces</h3>
            <p>The metaverse concept is evolving beyond gaming into genuine social platforms. Virtual workspaces, concerts, education, and social gatherings are becoming commonplace. Platforms like Horizon Worlds and VRChat demonstrate how VR can create meaningful social connections across distances.</p>

            <h3>Enterprise Applications</h3>
            <p>Beyond entertainment, VR is transforming industries. Surgeons practice complex procedures in VR simulations. Architects walk through buildings before construction begins. Remote workers collaborate in virtual offices. The enterprise VR market is projected to reach $50 billion by 2026.</p>

            <h3>Mixed Reality Integration</h3>
            <p>The line between VR and AR is blurring. Passthrough technology allows users to see the real world through their headsets, enabling mixed reality experiences that blend virtual and physical environments. Apple's Vision Pro represents this convergence, offering spatial computing that adapts to any environment.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility and Affordability</h3>
            <p>As technology improves and production scales up, VR headsets are becoming more affordable. Entry-level devices now cost less than gaming consoles, making VR accessible to mainstream consumers. This democratization is driving content creation and platform development.</p>

            <h3>Challenges Ahead</h3>
            <p>Despite progress, challenges remain. Motion sickness affects some users. Battery life limits session duration. Privacy concerns around data collection need addressing. However, ongoing research and development continue to tackle these issues, bringing us closer to truly seamless virtual reality.</p>
